# Control Structures in R 
# Control structures allows for control of flow of program depending on runtime conditions  
# if, else - testing a condition 
# for - execute a loop a fixed number of times 
# repeat - execute an infinite loop 
# break - break execution of a loop 
# next - skip an iteration of a loop 
# return - exit a function 
# Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but in functions or expressions 

# If, else, else if 
x = 4
if (x > 3) {
  y <- "greater than 3"
} else {
  y <- "smaller than 3"
}
y

# The else is not necessary if not required
